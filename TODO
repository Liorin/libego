* features
   - plan global assert strategy
   
* performance
   - 2 stage playout algorithm / optimization
   - think about copying constructot
   - reduce thrasing around on the end of the playout
   - additional layer for chain_at
   - try two phases 1. any eye is bad, play_no_eye 2. play eyes      

   - bzero, here and there
   - for_each_on_board
   - test smaller nunmber of guardians a'la GnuGo

   - mark most expensive debugs
   - compress move ? 
   - maybe indexing with move::t is better (nbr_cnt, other?)
   - maybe introduce pointers elshwere to ommit one addition?
   - check common expresion elim and if condition in play_no_lib
