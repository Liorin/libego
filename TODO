* features
   - fix README (mercy rule)
   - plan global assert tactic
   - load default file
   - 2 stage playout algorithm / optimization
   
* beautyfication
   - why do we need to do #ifdef's on #pragma once ?
   - remove all rep(v, v::cnt)
   - remove all other rep(v, *::cnt) and all rep
   - check all player <-> color
   - unused is needed when assert and NDEBUG, why?
   - add for_each_nbr in play_no_lib and everywhere
   - move zobrist into board_t
   - better print

* performance
   - think about copying constructot
   - reduce thrasing around on the end of the playout
   - try other random generators
   - additional layer for chain_at
   - try two phases 1. any eye is bad, play_no_eye 2. play eyes      
   - too many if's inside playout-run

   - bzero, here and there
   - for_each_on_board
   - test smaller nunmber of guardians a'la GnuGo

   - mark most expensive debugs
   - compress move ? 
   - maybe indexing with move::t is better (nbr_cnt, other?)
   - maybe introduce pointers elshwere to ommit one addition?
   - check common expresion elim and if condition in play_no_lib
