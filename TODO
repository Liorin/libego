* board.cpp
   - check all player <-> color
   - remove all TODOs
   - remove all rep(v, v::cnt)
   - remove all other rep(v, *::cnt) and all rep
   - add no_more_legal
   - place_stone, remove_stone ktore zachowuje: hash, color_at, nbr_cnt, MOZE: chain_at i captured
   - plan global assert tactic
   - remove find_root from assertions (npc)
   - check should be assert dependant
   - add more board_t::print() 's
   - unused is needed when assert and NDEBUG, why?
   - for_each_on_board
   - move zobrist into board_t
   - additional layer for chain_at
   - remove captured array
   - solve "pointer copying problem" in load in a better way
   - is new_chain_root really needed (in play)
   - add for_each_nbr in play_no_lib and everywhere
   - better print
   - add aout uint testing in Board.cpp and Makefile
      
   * performance
   - in playout we always know: play or play_no_lib
   - add static everywhere
   - mark most expensive debugs
   - test smaller nunmber of guardians a'la GnuGo
   - compress move ? 
   - check performacne of alignment of board_t color_at, chain_at, chain_next_v, nbr_cnt
   - maybe indexing with move::t is better (nbr_cnt, other?)
   - maybe introduce pointers elshwere to ommit one addition?
   - check common expresion elim and if condition in play_no_lib
   - bzero, here and there
